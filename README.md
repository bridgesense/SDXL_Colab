# SDXL 1.0 and ComfyUI: A Seamless Integration

Welcome to the world of ComfyUI, a paradigm shift in interface design. With its ability to re-execute only the "changed parts" of the workflow, ComfyUI stands out for its efficiency. This is important when conserving GPU time purchased on Colab. 

After you run out of your introductory GPU units, the $10 purchase of 100 GPU units for 90 days is the best option.  You'll be pleasantly surprised on how far that takes you.

## Embarking on Your Journey:

1. **Initialization**: Begin by loading `ComfyUI.ipynb` into your Colab environment.
2. **Power Up**: Ensure you're connected to a GPU. It's not optional.
3. **Setting the Stage**: Execute the 'Environment Setup'. Opting for the Google Drive feature? Your subsequent sessions will be quicker, thanks to the cached code.
4. **Gathering Resources**: Activate 'Checkpoints'. Depending on your selections, this might take a moment. A static play button signals completion.
5. **Gateway to ComfyUI**: Launch 'ComfyUI with localtunnel'. The play button remains active, indicating the local web server's operation.
6. **Access Point**: Await the URL output. First, note down the IP address. Subsequently, click on the provided URL to open a new browser tab. An example output might resemble:

```
The password/enpoint ip for localtunnel is: 65.197.156.22
your url is: https://cool-groups-grab.loca.lt
```

7. **Dive into ComfyUI**: Allow the new tab to load ComfyUI. Patience is key here. A fully-loaded workflow on the screen indicates you're all set.

## Mastery Over the Workflow:

YouTube has a trove of tutorials on ComfyUI. As I delve deeper into ComfyUI, expect this guide to evolve with added functionalities. The current version incorporates the 'Derfuu Modded Nodes' plugin, essential for the img2img workflow.

Kickstart things by hitting the "Queue Prompt" button. The initial run might test your patience, but rest assured, subsequent runs are run much faster.

Eager to explore some sample workflows? Hit 'Clear', followed by 'Load', and choose a workflow that piques your interest. The workflows presented here are tailored for this Colab project, ensuring you don't need additional modules or filters.
